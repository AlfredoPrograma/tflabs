# TFLabs
This repository is a curated collection of hands-on labs demonstrating the use of Terraform to provision and manage various AWS services. Each lab focuses on a specific AWS component or scenario, providing practical experience with Infrastructure as Code (IaC) principles. The goal is to showcase proficiency in Terraform and AWS by implementing real-world infrastructure scenarios.

## üöÄ Labs Overview
The labs are organized to cover a broad spectrum of AWS services and Terraform functionalities:

- [x] **EC2 Instance Deployment**: Provision a basic EC2 instance with custom configurations.
- [x] **S3 Bucket Configuration and Replication**: Create and manage S3 buckets with versioning and cross-region replication.
- [x] **VPC Setup**: Design a Virtual Private Cloud with public and private subnets, route tables, and gateways.
- [x] **IAM Management**: Implement IAM users, groups, roles, and policies for access control.
- [x] **Auto Scaling and Load Balancing**: Configure Auto Scaling Groups with Application Load Balancers for high availability.
- [ ] **Serverless Application**: Set up AWS Lambda functions integrated with API Gateway for a serverless architecture.
- [ ] **Messaging Services**: Implement SNS topics and SQS queues for decoupled communication.
- [ ] **Monitoring and Alerts**: Use CloudWatch to monitor resources and set up alarms for proactive notifications.
- [ ] **Reusable Modules**: Develop and utilize Terraform modules for consistent and reusable infrastructure components.
- [ ] **RDS Instance Provisioning**: Deploy a managed relational database with parameter groups and subnet configurations.

Each lab includes detailed instructions, Terraform configuration files, and cleanup procedures to ensure a smooth learning experience.
